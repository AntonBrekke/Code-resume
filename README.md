# Code resume

## C++
 All C++-files where made in collaberation with a group during the FYS3150-course taken at UiO. 

 Authors of the C++-files include: 
 - Anton Andreas Brekke
 - Johan Luciano Jahre Carlsen 
 - Mads Saua Balto
 - Alireza Asghari

### Ising_model
In this project, we solved the Ising-model using Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). 
We used the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to pull samples from an unknown pdf, by 
using that thermal systems get states from the Boltzmann distribution. We calculated
energies and magnetization, and used OpenMP to parallelize multiple simulations. 

### Schrodinger_equation
In this project, we solved the Schrodinger equation as a PDE in 1+2 dimensions. We
initiate a potential that simulates slits, and simulate double and triple slit experiments. 

## Python

### Jupyter
